# Example: user data

This example uses the Centos 7 image from DigitalOcean and uses user data to install Docker.

## Running it

You can try out this example by providing a digitalocean access token and running `terraform apply`. Note that you may need to run `terraform init` first.

This example takes a while to complete, since Terraform is waiting until Docker is available on the provisioned droplets. This may take roughly 4 minutes.
